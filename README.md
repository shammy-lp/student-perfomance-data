# 📊 Student Performance Data Repository

Welcome to the **Student Performance Data Repository**! This repository contains datasets, analysis, and visualization scripts related to student performance studies.

## 🗂️ Repository Overview

This repository is designed to analyze and explore factors that influence student performance using statistical methods and data science techniques. It includes data preprocessing, analysis and visualizations.

## 📊 Dataset

The datasets in this repository contain student-related information such as grades, demographic features, social conditions, and other variables that may affect academic performance.

### Dataset Files
- `student_data.csv`: Primary data containing student demographics and academic performance information.
- `cleaned_student_data.csv`: Preprocessed/cleaned data for analysis and machine learning.
- `student_data_large.csv`: A larger, extended dataset with additional features.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools Used
The analysis and experiments are built using:

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Tablueau

## 🚀 Features
- Data cleaning & preprocessing routines.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) visualizations.
- Tablueau visualizations for predicting student performances metrics.

## 🏆 Goals
1. Analyze trends in student performance metrics based on demographic variables.
2. Explore machine learning models for predicting grades based on historical and demographic data.
3. Visualize patterns and insights through graphs and statistical analysis.
