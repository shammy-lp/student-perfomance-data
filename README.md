# 📊 Student Performance Data Repository

Welcome to the **Student Performance Data Repository**! This repository contains datasets, analysis, and visualization scripts related to student performance studies.

## 🗂️ Repository Overview

This repository is designed to analyze and explore factors that influence student performance using statistical methods and data science techniques. It includes data preprocessing, analysis and visualizations.

## 📊 Dataset

The datasets in this repository contain student-related information such as grades, demographic features, social conditions, and other variables that may affect academic performance.

### Dataset Files
- `student_data.csv`: Primary data containing student demographics and academic performance information.
- `cleaned_student_data.csv`: Preprocessed/cleaned data for analysis and machine learning.
- `student_data_large.csv`: A larger, extended dataset with additional features.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools Used
The analysis and experiments are built using:

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Tablueau


## 🚀 Features
